## Instructions to run:
  First, in the project directory run:
  ### `npm install`
  to install all required packages. 
  There are **two additional packages that must be manually installed.** 
  These packages are:
  @material-ui/core 
  @material-ui/icons
  react-redux
  
  You can install these packages using the node package manager, npm.
  For reference, we use node v8.12.0
  
  Since the project is not deployed on a valid domain as of now, you'll need to 
  **disable CORS** in your web browser to run the program correctly.

  Now to start the project, run 
  ### `npm start`
